                    <p>Christopher Nolan received attention for his early films, Following (1998) and Memento (2000). After directing Insomnia, Nolan's next film was Batman Begins, a re-launch of the comic-book franchise that became a worldwide hit. The
                        film's sequel, The Dark Knight, broke box office records, and Nolan's sci-fi thriller, Inception, became another blockbuster two years later. In 2012, he produced the third film of his Batman saga, The Dark Knight Rises. Nolan
                        followed with the space odyssey Interstellar in 2014 and the World War II film Dunkirk in 2017.</p>

                    <p>
                        Steven Allan Spielberg ( born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era and one of the most popular directors and producers in film history. Spielberg
                        started in Hollywood directing television and several minor theatrical releases. He became a household name as the director of Jaws (1975), which was critically and commercially successful and is considered the first summer blockbuster.[3]
                        His subsequent releases focused typically on science fiction/adventure films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and its later sequels as part of the Indiana Jones franchise, E.T. the
                        Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and Jurassic Park (1993), which became archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.

                    <h2>About his Life</h2>
                    <p> Francis Ford Coppola (born April 7, 1939) is an American filmmaker. He was a central figure in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.
                        After directing The Rain People in 1969, Coppola co-wrote Patton (1970), earning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of The
                        Godfather (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, and was adored by the public and critics alike. The Godfather won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay (shared
                        with Mario Puzo).
